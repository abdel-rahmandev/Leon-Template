# Leon: HTML & CSS Template One
- This project is a complete HTML & CSS Template for practice from [Elzero Academia](https://elzero.org/).
- This is a practice after complete the [HTML course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAw_t_XWUFbBX-c9MafPk9ji) and [CSS course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzjsz06gkzlSrlev53MGIKe) and its assignments.
- I created the project after watched its [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzHSjcR-HnW9tnxyuye8KbF) on [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElzeroInfo/) Channel.
- The project's target is to try to use every skill that I learned if possible and make improvements on the project's final form.
